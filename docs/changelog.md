# Changelog

Here you'll find a record of changes made to these docs. I won't mention smaller changes 
much, so expect to mostly see new pages and the dates they were added.

This is also partially here so readers can see the date of the last update. When the 
next engine update arrives, check here to see if I've updated the docs yet to reflect 
new changes or new information.
