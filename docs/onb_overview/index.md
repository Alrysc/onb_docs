# Overview

The pages under this tab will introduce you to some of the tools Open Net 
Battle offers, and give a sort of "tech" overview. I won't go deep into object
usage in this section, nor will I document every aspect of them. 

You will not find documentation of every engine function in these pages. For that, see here:
[https://paintylux.github.io/OpenNetBattleDocs](https://paintylux.github.io/OpenNetBattleDocs).
Make sure to click into the `Main Docs`, `Classes & Functions`, and `Code Snippets` tabs.

Those linked docs are incomplete, and some information may be a little inaccurate. Just 
small things that you might notice. For example, some index access is shown to use a colon 
in places where you might have to use a period. If you find any information here that contradicts
what you could find there, trust what I write. 

## Capitalized Words

Every time you see the name of an object type and it's capitalized, I'm referring to the 
object type. Pay attention to this when wording would otherwise be ambiguous, like when 
a variable named `tile` refers to a Tile class object.

You'll notice this mostly when I talk about Player, the object, versus player, the person 
behind the screen playing the game. Be careful not to confuse those.
