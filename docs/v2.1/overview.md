# v2.1
v2.1 pulls some fixes, changes, and features from ahead in the repo's history, and even from 
Jamesking's work on the upcoming v2.5, with extra help from James in devising and revising 
the new systems in play that weren't in v2.5 yet.

This is a mostly non-breaking update. Very, very few mods should be broken, but some
behavior has been affected, and new behavior is now possible that you may want to implement. 
Read the [changelog](./changelog.md), then see [Recommended Mod Upgrades](./recommended_upgrades.md).
Even if you don't have any mods to upgrade, that page also has usage suggestions and examples 
for new features.

There are just a couple breaking changes, which affect features or behavior used by extremely 
few mods. See [breaking changes](./recommended_upgrades.md) for more info.

If any mods have broken or have unexpected changed behavior unrelated to the ones documented here,
ping me (Alrysc) on Discord and I can help you diagnose.
